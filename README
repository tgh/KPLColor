-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KPLColor is a program that takes Kernel Programming Langauge source files and
outputs syntax highlighted HTML files for printing through a web browser.

It is a Java program, but it is Java code constructed from the JFlex tool.  I
only wrote the KPLColor.jflex file and the KPLTokens.java file--JFlex created
the KPLColor.java program using my .jflex file.

The point of this program is so that I could print out KPL source code with
colored syntax for my cs333 Operating Systems course at Portland State
University.  The course uses a language created by an associate professor,
Harry Porter, at Portland State, so there is not much out there in terms of
syntax highlighting for KPL.

I'm sure more experienced students just use emacs, vim, enscript, or whatever
for there own syntax highlighting, but I thought I would use the skills I just
picked up from my cs321 Languages & Compiler Design course to utilize JFlex
some more.

Of course, this is not at all useful when writing KPL source code in any text
editor--it is only for printing prettier KPL source code.

When I say that this program outputs HTML files, it actually prints HTML code
to standard out--it is up to you to redirect into a new file (see next section.)
I didn't feel like dealing with file i/o for this--having the user redirect in
a shell is easier.

Line numbers are also included in the output.

                            INSTALLING/RUNNING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use KPLColor from scratch, do the following:

1. install jflex in your machine (if you don't already have it)

    $ sudo apt-get install jflex

   in Linux, or just go to http://jflex.de/

2. run jflex on KPLColor.jflex

    $ jflex KPLColor.jflex

3. compile the resulting KPLColor.java file along with KPLTokens.java

    $ javac KPLColor.java KPLTokens.java

4. run the program on a KPL source code file AND redirect it to a new file
   (otherwise it will just print to standard out)

    $ java KPLColor kplfile.c > kplfile.html

5. Now you can open up the HTML file in a web browser and print it.


You could also just grab the .class files if you don't feel like doing the
compiling.

                               BUG REPORTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I ran through this quickly, and didn't spend that much time testing, so there's
probably some bugs in here.

Send me an e-mail: tgh@pdx.edu.
